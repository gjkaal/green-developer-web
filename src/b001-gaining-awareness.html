                            Green software development refers to the practice of developing software in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. 
                            It focuses on reducing the environmental impact of software throughout its lifecycle, including development, deployment, and maintenance.
                            There are several reasons why we should all be concerned with green software development:

                            <section id="impact">
                                <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The IT industry, including software development, has a significant carbon footprint. 
                                    By adopting green software development practices, we can reduce energy consumption, minimize electronic waste, 
                                    and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This helps to mitigate the negative impact on the environment and 
                                    contribute to a more sustainable future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Green software development can also help to address the growing problem of e-waste. 
                                    By designing software that is energy-efficient and resource-conscious, we can reduce the 
                                    environmental impact of electronic devices and extend their lifespan. This can help to 
                                    reduce the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills and contribute to a 
                                    more sustainable approach to technology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is important to have metrics in place to measure the environmental impact of software development.
                                    By tracking energy consumption, carbon emissions, and resource usage, we can identify areas for improvement.
                                    From a business point of view, the best way to start, is to think about policies and procedures that can be implemented.
                                    This can be as simple as: <i>"Turn off the lights when you leave the office"</i>, 
                                    <i>"Use darkmode in applications and on websites whenever possible"</i> or a more complex policy as: 
                                    <i>"Implement a policy that automatically turns off the servers when they are not in use"</i>.
                                </p>
                            </section>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <section id="costs">
                                <h5>Cost Savings</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Green software development can lead to cost savings in terms of energy consumption and resource utilization. 
                                    By optimizing code, reducing server loads, and implementing efficient algorithms, we can reduce the amount
                                    of energy required to run software applications. This not only benefits the environment but also helps 
                                    organizations save on energy costs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We, as developers, have been spoiled with faster and faster computers, and more storage capacity than ever. 
                                    But we have to remember that this does not mean we can be wasteful. We have to think about the resources we use,
                                    down to the size of a record in a database and the number of code lines in a file. The Appollo Space Program
                                    had to think about the weight of the ink in the pens they used, and the computers they used had less capacity
                                    than the phone you are holding in your hand right now. This is a good reminder that we can create amazing things,
                                    even with limited resources.
                                </p>
                            </section>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <section id="experience">
                                <h5>User Experience</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Green software development can improve the user experience by creating more efficient and responsive applications. 
                                    Optimized code and efficient algorithms result in faster load times, smoother performance, and reduced resource usage. 
                                    This leads to a better user experience and increased customer satisfaction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To get a better user experience, does not always mean that the software itself will be less complicated. For instance,
                                    moving data to cold storage when it is used less frequently, will reduce the amount of energy that is used to store 
                                    the data, but it will also increase the complexity of the software.
                                </p>

                                    Many organizations are now prioritizing sustainability and environmental responsibility as part 
                                    of their corporate social responsibility initiatives. By adopting green software development practices, 
                                    companies can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and attract environmentally conscious 
                                    customers and partners.

                                    The European Union has a directive that requires all companies to report on their environmental impact.
                                    This directive is called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The directive requires 
                                    companies to report on their environmental impact, social impact, and impact on human rights.
